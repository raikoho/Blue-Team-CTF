As an IT department personnel of SwiftSpend Financial, one of your responsibilities is to support your fellow employees with their technical concerns. While everything seemed ordinary and mundane, this gradually changed when several employees from various departments started reporting an unusual email they had received. Unfortunately, some had already submitted their credentials and could no longer log in.

## You now proceeded to investigate what is going on by:

- Analysing the email samples provided by your colleagues.
- Analysing the phishing URL(s) by browsing it using Firefox.
- Retrieving the phishing kit used by the adversary.
- Using CTI-related tooling to gather more information about the adversary.
- Analysing the phishing kit to gather more information about the adversary.
